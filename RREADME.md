# VSAT Bandwidth Calculation Program

This is a simple GUI application built with Tkinter in Python that calculates the bandwidth for a VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) based on user inputs such as FEC rate, data rate, modulation order, and roll-off factor.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (typically included with Python installation)

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

3. Clone this repository or download the `vsat_bandwidth_calculator.py` file.

4. Run the program by executing the following command:

5. The GUI application window will open, providing input fields for FEC rate, data rate, modulation order, and roll-off factor.

6. Enter the respective values in the input fields, ensuring they fall within the specified ranges mentioned in the application (FEC rate: 0.5-0.95, Roll-off factor: 0.20-0.50).

7. Click the "Calculate" button to perform the calculation.

8. The calculated symbol rate and bandwidth will be displayed in the corresponding labels on the GUI.
